	abstract = {The monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) population in North America has sharply declined over the last two decades. Despite rising concern over the monarch butterfly's status, no comprehensive study of the factors driving this decline has been conducted. Using partial least-squares regressions and time-series analysis, we investigated climatic and habitat-related factors influencing monarch population size from 1993 to 2014. Potential threats included climatic factors, habitat loss (milkweed and overwinter forest), disease and agricultural insecticide use (neonicotinoids). While climatic factors, principally breeding season temperature, were important determinants of annual variation in abundance, our results indicated strong negative relationships between population size and habitat loss variables, principally glyphosate use, but also weaker negative effects from the loss of overwinter forest and breeding season use of neonicotinoids. Further declines in population size because of glyphosate application are not expected. Thus, if remaining threats to habitat are mitigated we expect climate-induced stochastic variation of the eastern migratory population of monarch butterfly around a relatively stationary population size.},

	abstract = {Exploring and describing biodiversity and the mechanisms structuring it is fundamental to advancing ecology. This is particularly pertinent in understudied biogeographical regions, such as the Afrotropics, that are characterised by strong seasonal climatic shifts. We investigated the characteristics of stream biodiversity in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, a tropical biodiversity hotspot, by examining patterns in 20 stream invertebrate communities across both the wet and dry seasons. For this, we took a multi-faceted approach accounting for the three levels of biodiversity (α, β and γ), including partitioning the nestedness and turnover components of β diversity, regional occupancy-abundance patterns, niche characteristics, and the environmental drivers of community structure. α diversity was low in these streams, with strong turnover between sites leading to high β diversity contributing to regional biodiversity, but there was little variation in communities between seasons. The proportion of sites occupied by taxa declined with increasing niche position, and decreasing niche breadth. Occupancy was predicted well by a combination of these two factors (niche position and breadth), but not mean local abundance, as the abundance-occupancy link was an upper-limit unimodal relationship. On average, community structure was linked more strongly to environmental variables in the wet season. Our findings demonstrate the clear role of spatial, but not temporal, turnover in assemblages, which likely reflects the environmental heterogeneity of this region. This is further supported by the fact that regional occupancy was mostly related to niche characteristics, particularly niche position. We emphasise the importance of continued basic and applied ecological work in this important biogeographic region to enable better protection of its biodiversity.},

	title = {Effects of fish predation on benthic communities in the {San} {Juan} {Archipelago}},
	url = {https://digital.lib.washington.edu:443/researchworks/handle/1773/35133},
	abstract = {Predation is a strong driver of community assembly, particularly in marine systems. Rockfish and other large fishes are the dominant predators in the rocky subtidal habitats of the San Juan Archipelago in NW Washington State. Here I examine the consumptive effects of these predatory fishes, beginning with a study of rockfish diet, and following with tests of the direct influence of predation on prey species and the indirect influence on other community members. In the first chapter I conducted a study of the diet of copper rockfish. Food web models benefit from recent and local data, and in this study I compared my findings with historic diet data from the Salish Sea and other localities along the US West Coast. Additionally, non-lethal methods of diet sampling are necessary to protect depleted rockfish populations, and I successfully used gastric lavage to sample these fish. Copper rockfish from this study fed primarily on shrimp and other demersal crustaceans, and teleosts made up a very small portion of their diet. Compared to previous studies, I found much higher consumption of shrimp and much lower consumption of teleosts, a difference that is likely due in part to geographic or temporal differences in prey availability. Given that copper rockfish diet was so dominated by shrimp, in the second chapter I used field experiments and surveys to determine the top-down effect of rockfish and other large demersal fishes on shrimp and other prey species. In three years of predator and prey surveys I found that shrimp abundance was negatively correlated with pooled predator biomass, but not abundance. Small fish and crab abundance were not correlated with predators. In two rounds of experimental exclusion of predatory fishes I found elevated abundance of both shrimp and small fishes in areas protected from predators. Despite this direct effect of predators on their prey, I did not find evidence of an indirect predator influence on the encrusting assemblage in the exclusion experiment. Trophic cascades are common in temperate marine ecosystems, often mediated by predators consuming urchins and urchins grazing on kelp. The San Juan Archipelago is notable for its lack of both urchin predators and strong grazing pressure from urchins. In the final chapter I looked for evidence of trophic cascades structuring the benthic community in this system. I surveyed the mobile invertebrates and sessile epibenthos at 12 sites within San Juan Channel, and compared these assemblages to predatory fishes to test for co-variance between the groups. Despite some limited evidence of co-variance between the predatory fishes and the other groups, the species involved did not suggest trophic relationships as the causal agent. Instead, predatory fishes may be responding to the biotic habitat provided by benthic organisms. Co-variation between the mobile invertebrates and sessile epibenthos provides supporting evidence of a three-species interaction between urchins, chitons, and social ascidians, and evidence of urchins reducing kelp cover. Finally, I compared these three assemblages to current flow and found strong evidence of current influencing assemblage composition. Although this benthic community does not appear to be controlled by a fish-initiated trophic cascade, consumptive interactions at lower trophic levels and dependence on abiotic factors play important structuring roles.},

	abstract = {The presence and distribution of green vegetation cover in the biosphere are of paramount importance in investigating cause-effect phenomena at the land/atmosphere interface, estimating primary production rates as part of global carbon and water cycle assessments and evaluating soil protection and land use change over time. The fraction of green vegetation cover (FCover) as estimated from satellite observations has already been demonstrated to be an extraordinarily useful product for understanding vegetation cover changes, for supporting ecosystem service assessments over areas with variable extents and for processes spanning a variable period of time (abrupt events or long-term processes). This study describes a methodology implemented to estimate global FCover (from 2001 to 2015) by applying a linear spectral mixture analysis with global endmembers to an entire temporal series of MODIS satellite observations and gap-ﬁlling missing FCover observations in temporal series using the DINEOF algorithm. The resulting global MODV1 FCover product was validated with two global validation datasets and showed an overall good thematic absolute accuracy (RMSE = 0.146) consistent with the validation performance of other FCover global products. Basic statistics performed on the product show changes in average and trend values and allow for the quantiﬁcation of gross vegetation loss and gain over different temporal scales. To demonstrate the capacity of this global product to monitor speciﬁc dynamics, a multitemporal analysis was performed on selected sites and vegetation responses (i.e., cover changes), and speciﬁc dynamics resulting from cause-effect phenomena are brieﬂy discussed. The product is intended to be used for monitoring vegetation dynamics, but it also has the potential to be integrated in other modeling frameworks (e.g., the carbon cycle, primary production, and soil erosion) in conjunction with other spatial datasets such as those on climate and soil type.},

            ABSTRACT
            
              Up to 20\% of prokaryotic organisms in the oceans are estimated to die every day due to viral infection and lysis. Viruses can therefore alter microbial diversity, community structure, and biogeochemical processes driven by these organisms. Cyanophages are viruses that infect and lyse cyanobacterial cells, adding bioavailable carbon and nutrients into the environment. Cyanobacteria are photosynthesizing bacteria, with some species capable of N
              2
              fixation, which are known to form large blooms as well as resistant resting cells known as akinetes. Here, we investigated cyanophage diversity and community structure plus cyanobacteria in dead zone sediments. We sampled surface sediments and sequenced DNA and RNA, along an oxygen gradient—representing oxic, hypoxic, and anoxic conditions—in one of the world’s largest dead zones located in the Baltic Sea. Cyanophages were detected at all stations and, based on partial genome contigs, had a higher alpha diversity and different beta diversity in the hypoxic-anoxic sediments, suggesting that cyanobacteria in dead zone sediments and/or environmental conditions select for specific cyanophages. Some of these cyanophages can infect cyanobacteria with potential consequences for gene expression related to their photosystem and phosphate regulation. Top cyanobacterial genera detected in the anoxic sediment included
              Dolichospermum
              /
              Anabaena
              ,
              Synechococcus
              , and
              Cyanobium
              . RNA transcripts classified to cyanobacteria were associated with numerous pathways, including anaerobic carbon metabolism and N
              2
              fixation. Cyanobacterial blooms are known to fuel oxygen-depleted ecosystems with phosphorus (so-called internal loading), and our cyanophage data indicate the potential for viral lysis of cyanobacteria which might explain the high nutrient turnover in these environments.
            
            
              IMPORTANCE
              Cyanophages are viruses that target cyanobacteria and directly control their abundance via viral lysis. Cyanobacteria are known to cause large blooms in water bodies, substantially contributing to oxygen depletion in bottom waters resulting in areas called dead zones. Our knowledge of cyanophages in dead zones is very scarce, and so far, no studies have assembled partial cyanophage genomes and investigated their associated cyanobacteria in these dark and anoxic sediments. Here, we present the first study using DNA and RNA sequencing to investigate
              in situ
              diversity of cyanophages and cyanobacteria in dead zones. Our study shows that dead zone sediments contain different cyanophages compared to oxic sediments and suggest that these viruses are able to affect cyanobacterial photosystem and phosphate regulation. Furthermore, cyanophage-controlled lysis of cyanobacteria might also increase the turnover of carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen in these oxygen-free environments at the bottom of the sea.},

	abstract = {Background: Changes in gut microbiota are associated with cardiometabolic disorders and are inﬂuenced by diet. Almonds are a rich source of ﬁber, unsaturated fats, and polyphenols, all nutrients that can favorably alter the gut microbiome.
Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of 8 wk of almond snacking on the gut (fecal) microbiome diversity and abundance compared with an isocaloric snack of graham crackers in college freshmen.
Methods: A randomized, controlled, parallel-arm, 8-wk intervention in 73 college freshmen (age: 18–19 y; 41 women and 32 men; BMI: 18–41 kg/m2) with no cardiometabolic disorders was conducted. Participants were randomly allocated to either an almond snack group (56.7 g/d; 364 kcal; n = 38) or graham cracker control group (77.5 g/d; 338 kcal/d; n = 35). Stool samples were collected at baseline and 8 wk after the intervention to assess primary microbiome outcomes, that is, gut microbiome diversity and abundance.
Results: Almond snacking resulted in 3\% greater quantitative alpha-diversity (Shannon index) and 8\% greater qualitative alpha-diversity (Chao1 index) than the cracker group after the intervention (P {\textless} 0.05). Moreover, almond snacking for 8 wk decreased the abundance of the pathogenic bacterium Bacteroides fragilis by 48\% (overall relative abundance, P {\textless} 0.05). Permutational multivariate ANOVA showed signiﬁcant time effects for the unweighted UniFrac distance and Bray–Curtis beta-diversity methods (P {\textless} 0.05; R2 ≤ 3.1\%). The dietary and clinical variables that best correlated with the underlying bacterial community structure at week 8 of the intervention included dietary carbohydrate (percentage energy), dietary ﬁber (g), and fasting total and HDL cholesterol (model Spearman rho = 0.16; P = 0.01).
Conclusions: Almond snacking for 8 wk improved alpha-diversity compared with cracker snacking. Incorporating a morning snack in the dietary regimen of predominantly breakfast-skipping college freshmen improved the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome.

While various methods exist to detect and record the presence and movements of individuals in combination with UAS, addressing these for smaller animals, such as insects, is challenging and often fails to reveal information on potential interactions. Here, we address this gap by combining the UAS-based detection of small tracers of fluorescent dyes by means of a simple experiment under field conditions for the first time. We (1) excited fluorescent tracers utilizing an UV radiation source and recorded images with an UAS, (2) conducted a semi-automated selection of training and test samples to (3) train a simple SVM classifier, allowing (4) the classification of the recorded images and (5) the automated identification of individual traces. The tracer detection success significantly decreased with increasing altitude, increasing distance from the UV radiation signal center, and decreasing size of the fluorescent traces, including significant interactions amongst these factors. As a first proof-of-principle, our approach has the potential to be broadly applicable in ecological research, particularly in insect monitoring.},

Researchers have proposed various algorithms to fill data gaps “below the clouds”, but a comparison of algorithm performance across several geographic regions has not yet been conducted. We compared ten basic algorithms, including data-interpolating empirical orthogonal functions (DINEOF), geostatistical interpolation, and supervised learning methods, in two gap-filling tasks: the reconstruction of chlorophyll a in pixels covered by clouds, and the correction of regional mean chlorophyll a concentrations. For this purpose, we combined tens of cloud-free images with hundreds of cloud masks in four study areas, creating thousands of situations in which to test the algorithms. The best algorithm depended on the study area and task, and differences between the best algorithms were small. Ordinary Kriging, spatiotemporal Kriging, and DINEOF worked well across study areas and tasks. Random forests reconstructed individual pixels most accurately. We also found that high levels of cloud cover led to considerable errors in estimated regional mean chlorophyll a concentration. These errors could, however, be reduced by about 50\% to 80\% (depending on the study area) with prior cloud-filling.},

            The Miocene convergence of the Sunda shelf, Sahul shelf and Wallacea facilitated the exchange of previously isolated floras across the Sunda–Sahul Convergence Zone (SSCZ). The SSCZ is a hotspot of biogeographical research; however, phytogeographical patterns across the region remain poorly understood. We conducted multivariate analysis on a comprehensive species checklist of SSCZ vascular plants to quantify the extent of exchange, characterize phytogeographical patterns and investigate their abiotic drivers. We found that Lydekker’s and Wallace’s Lines are not reflected in floristic composition at any taxonomic level, with 46\% of genera distributed across these biogeographical lines. In contrast, environment is significantly correlated with floristic composition, with annual rainfall and seasonality being the strongest correlates. Mainland Asia, Borneo, the Philippines, New Guinea and Australia were major routes of exchange throughout the Cenozoic, possibly because these areas have been persistent landmasses throughout the entire period of convergence. We conclude that Sunda–Sahul floristic exchange has substantially influenced the assembly of the regional flora and that modern phytogeographical patterns have been influenced more by environmental variables and available landmass (i.e. establishment conditions) than by putative barriers to movement such as Wallace’s and Lydekker’s Lines (i.e. vagility).},

Here, we investigated microbial communities through the soil profile at an industrial site, which was exposed to various petroleum products for over 50 years. The petroleum is present as light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) and is undergoing natural source zone depletion (NSZD). Microbial community composition was compared to the contaminant type, concentration, and its depth of obtained soil cores. A large population of Archaea, particularly Methanomicrobia and Methanobacteria and indication of complex syntrophic relationships of methanogens, methanotrophs and bacteria were found in the contaminated cores. Different families were enriched across the LNAPL types. Results indicate methanogenic or anoxic conditions in the deeper and highly contaminated sections of the soil cores investigated. The contaminant was highly weathered, likely resulting in the formation of recalcitrant polar compounds. This research provides insight into the microorganisms fundamentally associated with LNAPL, throughout a soil depth profile above and below the water table, undergoing NSZD processes at a legacy petroleum site. It advances the potential for integration of microbial community effects on bioremediation and in response to physicochemical partitioning of LNAPL components from different petroleum types.},

One field received uniform application of manure, the second field received the uniform applications of the chemical nitrogen fertilizer, and the third field received variable rate applications of the chemical fertilizer. The preferential subsurface flow and storage pathway locations were inferred from the ground penetration radar survey. Six-year monitoring data were analyzed. Statistical distributions of EOFs across fields were approximately symmetrical. Semivariograms of the first EOF differed between fields receiving manure and chemical fertilizer. This EOF accounted for 52 to 56\% of the interannual variability of yields, and its values reflected the distance to the subsurface flow and storage pathways. The second and third EOF explained 17 to 20\% and 10 to 13\% of the interannual variability of yields, respectively. The precision applications of the nitrogen fertilizer minimized corn yield variability associated with subsurface preferential flow patterns. Investigating spatial patterns of yield variability under shallow groundwater flow control can be beneficial for the within-field crop management resource allocation.},

Recent studies have shown that ocean color (OC) may be used as a proxy for a range of physical and biological parameters, allowing for a more direct approach in defining and monitoring provinces. The current work investigates whether OC-derived provinces (area of a given OC type) can be identified in the North Sea and if they can provide insight into the system's dynamics. The analysis workflow was organized into three main steps: 1. OC type classification based on clustering of normalized reflectance spectra, 2. OC type characterization following match-ups to other biological and physical covariates, and 3. Exploration of drivers of OC province dynamics. Based on data from 1997–2019, four main OC types were identified, which are shown to be related to bio-optical, physical, and zooplankton community covariates. Atlantic-associated OC types varied in their coverage of the North Sea on seasonal and interannual scales, with increased penetration related to periods of a weakened circulation. Interannual variability of OC province extent was also found to correlate with an index of the Subpolar Gyre. These results indicate that the dynamics of OC provinces in the North Sea are likely driven by the interaction between large-scale circulation and local wind-driven and baroclinic currents. The perspective offered by OC provinces helps elucidate spatiotemporal patterns of plankton and is proposed as a novel operational index for additional exploration of ecosystem functioning.},

              It is difficult to disentangle the many variables (e.g. internal or external cues and random events) that shape the microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract of any living species. Ecological assembly processes applied to microbial communities can elucidate these drivers. In our study, farmed Atlantic cod (
              Gadus morhua
              ) were fed a diet of 10\% macroalgae supplement (
              Ulva rigida
              [ULVA] or
              Ascophyllum nodosum
              [ASCO] or a non-supplemented control diet [CTRL]) over 12 weeks. We determined the influence of ecological assembly processes using a suite of null-modelling tools. We observed dissimilarity in the abundance of common OTUs over time, which was driven by deterministic assembly. The CTRL samples showed selection as a critical assembly process. While dispersal limitation was a driver of the gut microbiome for fish fed the macroalgae supplemented diet at Week 12 (i.e., ASCO and ULVA). Fish from the ASCO grouping diverged into ASCO\_N (normal) and ASCO\_LG (lower growth), where ASCO\_LG individuals found the diet unpalatable. The recruitment of new taxa overtime was altered in the ASCO\_LG fish, with the gut microbiome showing phylogenetic underdispersion (nepotistic species recruitment). Finally, the gut microbiome (CTRL and ULVA) showed increasing robustness to taxonomic disturbance over time and lower functional redundancy. This study advances our understanding of the ecological assembly and succession in the hindgut of juvenile Atlantic cod across dietary treatments. Understanding the processes driving ecological assembly in the gut microbiome, in fish research specifically, could allow us to manipulate the microbiome for improved health or resilience to disease for improved aquaculture welfare and production.},

	abstract = {Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune condition, characterised by joint pain, damage and disability, which can be addressed in a high proportion of patients by timely use of targeted biologic treatments. However, the patients, non-responsive to the treatments often suffer from refractoriness of the disease, leading to poor quality of life. Additionally, the biologic treatments are expensive. We obtained plasma samples from N = 144 participants with RA, who were about to commence anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy. These samples were sent to Olink Proteomics, Uppsala, Sweden, where proximity extension assays of 4 panels, containing 92 proteins each, were performed. A total of n = 89 samples of patients passed the quality control of anti-TNF treatment response data. The preliminary analysis of plasma protein expression values suggested that the RA population could be divided into two distinct molecular sub-groups (endotypes). However, these broad groups did not predict response to anti-TNF treatment, but were significantly different in terms of gender and their disease activity. We then labelled these patients as responders (n = 60) and non-responders (n = 29) based on the change in disease activity score (DAS) after 6 months of anti-TNF treatment and applied machine learning (ML) with a rigorous 5-fold nested cross-validation scheme to filter 17 proteins that were significantly associated with the treatment response. We have developed a ML based classifier ATRPred (anti-TNF treatment response predictor), which can predict anti-TNF treatment response in RA patients with 81\% accuracy, 75\% sensitivity and 86\% specificity. ATRPred may aid clinicians to direct anti-TNF therapy to patients most likely to receive benefit, thus save cost as well as prevent non-responsive patients from refractory consequences.

            Distinct microbial assemblages are engineered in anaerobic digestion (AD) reactors to drive sequential conversions of organics to methane. The spatio-temporal development of three such assemblages (granules, biofilms, planktonic) derived from the same inoculum was studied in replicated bioreactors treating long-chain fatty acids (LCFA)-rich wastewater at 20°C at hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 12-72 h. We found granular, biofilm and planktonic assemblages differentiated by diversity, structure, and assembly mechanisms; demonstrating a spatial compartmentalisation of the microbiomes from the initial community reservoir.

This study of the archaea and syntrophic bacteria actively valorising LCFAs at short HRTs and 20°C will help uncover the microbiology underpinning anaerobic bioconversions of fats, oil and grease.

Organic spring deposits, which occur throughout the Kimberley region of northwest Australia, are valuable archives that contain records spanning the past {\textasciitilde}14,500 years. In this study we compare multiple proxies from three organic springs. Principal Components Analyses demonstrates similar patterns of change in the elemental and non-pollen palynomorph (NPP) datasets between the springs, implying regional drivers are responsible for changes in these proxies. By comparison, the pollen records differ between each of the springs, with the assemblage at each thought to be inﬂuenced by spring recharge and evolution rather than climate variability. In order to empirically and objectively assess the synchronicity of changes, we applied Monte Carlo empirical orthogonal function (MCEOF) analysis to one variable in each mXRF and NPP dataset (Si/Ti ratios and Pseudoschizaea accumulation rates, as these proxies are expected to reﬂect hydrological conditions in springs) to assess regional patterns of change in site moisture. This analysis revealed periods of increased monsoonal precipitation from {\textasciitilde}14,500e7500 cal. yr BP corresponding with deglacial sea level rise, high orbital tilt coupled with warmer sea surface temperatures, and with possible links to a southward migration of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during the Younger Dryas. Monsoonal precipitation was reduced from 7500 cal. yr BP coinciding with the culmination of deglacial sea level rise and a possible northward shift in the mean position of the ITCZ, in addition to between 2600 and 1000 cal. yr BP corresponding with increased moderate-to-strong ENSO events.},

	abstract = {We consider spatio-temporal data and functional data with spatial dependence, characterized by complicated missing data patterns. We propose a new method capable to efficiently handle these data structures, including the case where data are missing over large portions of the spatio-temporal domain. The method is based on regression with partial differential equation regularization. The proposed model can accurately deal with data scattered over domains with irregular shapes and can accurately estimate fields exhibiting complicated local features. We demonstrate the consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimators. Moreover, we illustrate the good performances of the method in simulations studies, considering different missing data scenarios, from sparse data to more challenging scenarios where the data are missing over large portions of the spatial and temporal domains and the missing data are clustered in space and/or in time. The proposed method is compared to competing techniques, considering predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification measures. Finally, we show an application to the analysis of lake surface water temperature data, that further illustrates the ability of the method to handle data featuring complicated patterns of missingness and highlights its potentiality for environmental studies.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic alterations to global ecosystems necessitate management action to conserve or restore biodiversity and ecosystem services. A major advancement in ecosystem management was the development of multimetric indices of biotic integrity (MMIBI) used to guide development of, and measure progress towards, restoration goals. Despite considerable reﬁnement of MMIBI applications over the past three decades, a central challenge remains concerning the method of selecting ecological indicators for inclusion in MMIBI. We quantitatively compared MMIBI metric assembly processes across four sub-regions for ﬁsh assemblages in western Tennessee, USA to assess relative performance of three metric selection approaches. Metric selection methods we assessed included “ﬁlter gradient” using a multi-step approach to ﬁlter candidate metrics down to only the most reproducible and responsive, “indirect gradient” using a correlative unconstrained ordination approach, and “direct gradient” involving an automated constrained ordination approach. For each method, we calculated MMIBI using the selected metrics and compared their precision (i.e., stability across multiple samples), responsiveness (i.e., discrimination between most- and least-altered sites), and sensitivity (i.e., ability to detect landscape alterations). We found metric selection using the ﬁlter gradient approach produced MMIBI that were most responsive across all four sub-regions, while the indirect gradient approach produced the most sensitive and precise MMIBI for three of four sub-regions. The direct gradient metric selection approach produced the most sensitive MMIBI only for a single sub-region with a relatively short gradient in landscape alterations. These results reveal a tradeoﬀ between ﬁlter and indirect gradient selection methods in which ﬁlter gradient metric selection provides high MMIBI responsiveness, but at the cost of increased number of steps and reduced precision and sensitivity. The “middle of the road”, indirect gradient metric selection approach produced precise and sensitive MMIBI, but at the cost of reduced responsiveness. These ﬁndings highlight the necessity to pair welldeveloped ecosystem management goals with MMIBI application, and provide a road map for the most appropriate assembly process for managers developing MMIBI. For example, identiﬁcation of least- and most-altered sites might best be accomplished with MMIBI developed using the ﬁlter gradient approach, but assessing the factors contributing to alteration and precisely measuring progress towards restoration endpoints might best be accomplished with MMIBI developed using the indirect gradient approach. Restoration and management actions guided by MMIBI will become increasingly prevalent with increased future alteration to global ecosystems, and this work provides important insight into how technological and quantitative advances will improve application of ecological indicators.},

	abstract = {Settlement crises in ancient cultures of Western Asia are commonly thought to be caused by climatic events such as severe droughts. However, the insufficient climate proxy situation in this region challenges the inference of clear relationships between climate and settlement dynamics. We investigate the Holocene climatic changes on the Varamin Plain in the context of the climatic history of Western Central Asia by using a transient comprehensive Earth System Model simulation (8 ka BP to pre-industrial), a high-resolution regional snapshot simulation and a synthesis of pollen-based climate reconstructions. In line with the reconstructions, the models reveal only slightly varying mean climatic conditions on the Varamin Plain but indicate substantial changes in seasonality during the Holocene. Increased precipitation during spring, combined with lower temperature and potentially stronger snow accumulation on the upstream Alborz mountains may have led to an increased water supply on the alluvial fan during the vegetation period and thus to more favourable conditions for agricultural production during the Mid-Holocene compared to modern times. According to the model, dry periods on the Central Iranian Plateau are related to particularly weak Westerly winds, fostering the subsidence in the mid-troposphere and hampering precipitation over the region. The model reveals that dry periods have spatially heterogenous manifestations, thus explaining why they do not appear in all proxy records in the wider study region. In fact, the climatic signal may depend on local environmental conditions. The interaction of the topography with the atmospheric circulation leads to additional spatial heterogeneity. Although our results provide several indications for a connection between climate and settlement dynamics, the small overall changes in moisture call into question whether climate is the main driver for settlement discontinuities on the Central Iranian Plateau. To shed further light on this issue, more high-resolution long-term proxy records are needed.},

            The current study brings detailed Land Surface Temperature (LST) information on 6 medium and small cities located in north-eastern Romania, with urban features that are specific to eastern Europe. In this analysis 2273 Landsat images have been used, outlining the LST spatial distribution and its long term (1984–2022) evolution for the analyzed cities at LCZs level, but also enabling a sound spatial hot/cold spots identification. The methodological approach included LST products investigation, LCZ classification, trend analysis and cold/hot spots analysis using Getis-Ord Gi* statistic. The results indicate that for the warm season the highest LST values correspond to industrial areas (32–34 °C), while the tree-based green areas and the water bodies are the coldest (26–28 °C). Moreover, the built-up LCZ types are subject to a higher positive trend of LST, capable to determine an intensification of SUHI in most of the analyzed cities. Consequently, the industrial areas and the high densely built LCZs contribute mostly to urban hot spots development, while forests and water bodies around the cities are overlapping the cold spots. Hot/cold spots identification besides the understanding of their LCZ features serve as a useful tool for urban stakeholders in their effort to advance concrete measures to mitigate temperature extremes inside the urban areas.},
